<!-- # Quantitative Trading Bootcamp -->

Trading Bootcamp teaches the fundamentals of quantitative trading: markets, order books, auctions, risk and sizing, adverse selection, arbitrage, and how quant trading firms make money. 

The philosophy of this bootcamp is that the best way to learn to trade is by trading. We'll use a fake economy and exchange, run through many sessions of trading games designed to teach progressively more complex concepts, and auction off prizes at the end using our internal currency.

Our next session is Nov 6-10 in Berkeley, CA. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9auB4NCIXGHMcv41jFsvS1go2ufVVbcKmqUk9aByFdoIigA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
